# EU Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) Supply Chain Map

This project visualizes the rare-earth permanent-magnet (REPM) supply chain — specifically the **neodymium–iron–boron (NdFeB)** segment — within Europe, including the United Kingdom.  
The interactive web map displays companies (nodes) and material flows (edges) across key years (2010, 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024), illustrating the evolution of the supply network.

## Project Overview
This study aims to provide a transparent, data-driven understanding of how the European REPM supply chain has evolved over time.  
It highlights major processing, manufacturing, and recycling nodes, as well as the linkages between them.
